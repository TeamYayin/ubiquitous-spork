Our team designed a personal portfolio website for Dr. G Suryanaryana using the HUGO static website framework. The HUGO framework allowed us to create a fast and responsive website that is easy to maintain and update.

We used a minimalist design approach to keep the focus on the content and to ensure that the website is easy to navigate. We also included a screenshot of the website on the homepage to give visitors a preview of the website's design ([JSON Resume by Eddie Webbinaro](https://github.com/eddiewebb/hugo-resume)).

Overall, our team was able to create a professional and visually appealing website that effectively showcases Dr. Suryanaryana's skills and experience.
