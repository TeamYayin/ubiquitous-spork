In April 2023, a module was delivered for the Swadyamitra project of Indian Oil Corp. The module was developed using Spring Boot and Thymeleaf frameworks. Spring Boot is a popular Java-based framework used for building web applications, while Thymeleaf is a modern server-side Java template engine.

The Swadyamitra project is an initiative by Indian Oil Corp. aimed at providing skill development and employment opportunities to the youth in rural areas. The delivered module is expected to contribute to the project's goals by providing a platform for managing and tracking the progress of trainees.

The use of Spring Boot and Thymeleaf frameworks in the development of the module is significant as it ensures that the module is scalable, efficient, and easy to maintain. Spring Boot provides a robust and flexible architecture for building web applications, while Thymeleaf simplifies the process of creating dynamic web pages.

Overall, the successful delivery of the module for the Swadyamitra project using Spring Boot and Thymeleaf frameworks is a testament to the expertise and technical skills of the development team. The module is expected to play a crucial role in the success of the Swadyamitra project and contribute to the development of rural communities in India.
