We designed website for the Goverment Polytechnic College located in Maheshwaram, Rangareddy, Telangana. It was developed using the static web framework `Hugo` and [Educenter theme by Themeforest](https://themefisher.com/hugo-themes/)

We also designed a web gallery to provide virtual tour of the campus. It displays the infrastructure and labs photographs of the campus as a dynamic collage galery.
